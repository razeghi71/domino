## Requirements

- macOS 14+
- Swift 6.0+

## Build & Run

Run directly from source:

```
swift run Domino
```

## Install as macOS App

Bundle it into a proper `.app`:

```
./scripts/bundle.sh
```

This builds a release binary and creates `build/Domino.app`. To install:

```
cp -R build/Domino.app /Applications/
```

The app is unsigned, so on first launch you may need to right-click > Open (or allow it in System Settings > Privacy & Security).
